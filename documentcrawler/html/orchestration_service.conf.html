<h1>Configuring the orchestration service</h1><p>The orchestration service tells the crawler how to manage crawled files. Default options can be changed directly by opening the <code>config/orchestration/orchestration-service.conf</code> file, and modifying the following values specific to your use case:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>http_timeout</strong> - The timeout, in seconds, for the document read/index operation; the default is <code>585</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>concurrent_upload_connection_limit</strong> - The number of simultaneous connections allowed for uploading documents; the default is <code>10</code>. Generally, this number should be greater than, or equal to, the <code>output_limit</code> set when configuring crawl options.</li>
  <li><strong>base_url</strong> - The URL that your crawled documents will be sent to.</li>
  <li><strong>endpoint</strong> - The location of your crawled document collection at the <code>base-url</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>username</strong> - Username to authenticate to the <code>endpoint</code> location.</li>
  <li><strong>password</strong> - Password to authenticate to the <code>endpoint</code> location. <strong>Important</strong> - Do <strong>NOT</strong> use the vcrypt program shipped with the Data Crawler to encrypt this password.</li>
  <li><strong>config_file</strong> - The configuration file that the orchestration service uses.</li>
</ul><p>The Orchestration Service Output Adapter can send statistics in order for IBM to better understand and serve its users. The following options can be set for the <code>send_stats</code> variable:<br/>* <strong>jvm</strong> - Java Virtual Machine (JVM) statistics sent include the Java vendor and version, as reported by the JVM used to execute the data crawler. Value is either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.<br/>* <strong>os</strong> - Operating system (OS) statistics sent include OS name, version, and architecture, as reported by the JVM used to execute the data crawler. Value is either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p><h2>SEE ALSO</h2><p>crawler(1)</p><p>vcrypt(1)</p><p>crawler.conf(5)</p><p>crawler-options.conf(5)</p><p>crawler-seed.conf(5)</p>
